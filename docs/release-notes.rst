Holmes Rule Management Release Notes
====================================

Holmes provides alarm correlation and analysis for telecom cloud infrastructure
and services, including hosts, VIMs, VNFs and NSs. Holmes aims to find the root
reason which causes the failure or degradation of services by digging into the
ocean of events collected from different levels of the telecom cloud.

:Release Date: 2018-06-07


**New Features**
In the Beijing release, Holmes provides no more functionalites than the Amsterdam release. Its main features remains like follows:

- `Rule Management <https://jira.onap.org/browse/HOLMES-4>`_ The feature provides interfaces for the users to create, query, update and delete rules. In this release, they are used along with the DCAE interfaces to accomplish the deployment (creation/update) of the control loop related rules.
- `Engine Management <https://jira.onap.org/browse/HOLMES-5>`_ The feature is not exposed to the end user directly. It's mainly used internally by Holmes as a container for the execution of rules. It provides interface for rule verification and deployment/un-deployment.

Besides, Holmes has been enhanced to meet the platform maturity requirements. The enhancement mainly covers:

- Scaling: Holmes supports horizontal scale-in/scale-out operations in case it is overloaded by too large amounts of data.
- Security: Holmes has updated all its APIs to support the HTTPS protocol.
